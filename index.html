      <m>Environment of our planet earth</m>
      
      <p>For millions, planet earth's ecosystems and environment achieved a perfect harmony. Everything existed in balance; predator population and their prey kept each other's numbers in check and the earth's temperature was maintained, much like homeostasis in a living organism. Then came man. To begin with, we didn't have much of an impact upon the earth. We were hunter-gatherers,  living in harmony with nature. we killed what we needed for food, or for clothing. We took only those resources needed for building homes. As we developed and grew smarter, as our technologies became more advanced, our impact upon the earth became more pronounced. The advent of the industrial revolution in the 18<sup>th</sup> century brought with it a new and massively destructive problem-pollution.</p>
      <p>This has gotten progressively worse as population and industry have grown, to the point that we are literally destroying the planet that supports us and gives us life.</p>
      <p>People have finally woken up to the extent of this problem and we have started to develop alternatives to fossil fuels, like renewable energies, such as solar and wind power. This, however, needs to be implemented on a much wider scale than it currently is. Look at our city, Taichung. Now, I love my city, but it doesn't win many "Number 1 in the world" awards.</p>
